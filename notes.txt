// will be working in pages

// cleanup the CSS files and index.js

//_app.js will init our pages, whatever happens there will happen on every page!

//renaming js to jsx

//create folder in pages
//run localhost:3000/dogs/henry
//Link components, if we use a tag it will rerun the whole page, no no. we can test that it doesnt reload, and a tag does
//Link will prefetch (the page will already be downloaded, its not always needed...why should we use the resources, wasteful practice// possibility of prefetch)
      <Link prefetch={false} href="/dogs/henry">
// as a solution, we can create our own anchor tag!!
// so now it loads a single page site without prefetch


<Head> component is good for the meta tags, SEO and that sort of stuff

      in place of content we should use {Children}
      - use it in _app
